## 1. Guide, don't decide

{% hint style="info" %}
You're the navigator on a ship, somebody else should be the captain.
{% endhint %}

* You're not responsible for the outcome.
* Your goal is to enable the group to the best of their abilities to achieve a decision (a desired goal) in a timely manner.&#x20;
* Don't be a participant, stay neutral.

## 2. Encourage

{% hint style="info" %}
Allow participants to speak or to express themselves by giving equal opportunities.
{% endhint %}

* Create a safe space to speak up.
* Give everybody that joins the session a voice.
* Be a good listener.

## 3. Be clear and transparent

{% hint style="info" %}
Don’t leave too much space for interpretation in the strictness of time and responsibility.
{% endhint %}

* Set the expectations for timing up front.
* Create ‘rules’ for the session together with your participants in the beginning of the session.

## 4. Be resourceful

{% hint style="info" %}
Be well prepared but also ready to change course depending on factors you have no control over.
{% endhint %}

* Use what you've prepared and be creative when needed
* Be responsive and adaptable to external factors
* Consider the group size, dynamics, roles
* Be prepared to stretch or compress a method

## 5. Be confident

{% hint style="info" %}
You are the one that people want guidance from. Step in the role and bring a leadership mentality even if it doesn’t come naturally to you.
{% endhint %}

* Announce your role in the beginning of a session. Ask if everybody agrees that you will facilitate the session.
* If you signal resistance, emphasise the need for participation for the team’s and proces’ sake.

## 6. Inspire

{% hint style="info" %}
Bring the outcome of your team to the next level in process and content.
{% endhint %}

* Show starting points
* Give creative lead
* Keep a fine balance between exploration of ideas and making choices to pin down success
* End on a high note with clear actions.

## 7. Eyes on the prize

{% hint style="info" %}
Everything is in service of the goal. Be sure to get your team, where they want to be in the end.
{% endhint %}

* Discuss the main goal in the beginning of the meeting.
* Reflect on the goal in the end of the meeting.
* Try to have clear what purpose every individual technique has in your session in relation to the main goal.
