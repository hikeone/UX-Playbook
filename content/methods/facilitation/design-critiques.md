# Design Critiques for larger teams

The purpose of these critiques it to get detailed and constructive feedback on design specific solutions for a specific client or purpose. We get a select team of designers in a room with a designer to look at their solution or design and give constructive feedback on it. This will help designers gain insight in possible other solutions they might not have thought about till now. Helping them to improve their designs.\
\
So in order to make this a pleasant and useful experience for everyone we need some rules. On presenting the work but also on the feedback that is given. Here’s some structure and rules for the Hike One design critiques.

### Roles:

* Presenters (1-4 per critique - change every time)
* Facilitator (Roles from the design quality or academy circle) Rotating
* Note taker (Role from the quality circle) Rotating
* Critiquers (A max number of 8 is preferred)

### Creating an agenda (for the facilitators)

* Choose a topic or focus per session
* Gather presenters
* Ask them to prepare a 5 min presentation on what they want feedback on
* Let them gather background information (if needed) and include in invitation
* Gather invitees (critiquers and onlookers)
* Share critique rules with critiquers

### For the facilitator

Your role is an important one! It’s your job to make sure the presenter receives the right sort of feedback. Both actionable and honest. Making sure the work does not get ‘burned’ but rather improved by the input from the group. Rotating this role helps to create a different outcome or focus every time and gives the team the possibility to try different roles.\
Make sure the critiquers ask the right questions and don’t shoot from the hip. Don’t allow people to just give their opinions about, let’s say; layout. But help them ask about how this layout helps the user achieve their goals(s). Or if there might be other forms of layout that better serve this goal. Create order from (possible) chaos. Keep a focus on the feedback that is issued. Good feedback sits in the middle of being too kind and too harsh. Have a look at this model:

|                     | **Too negative**←                                                          | **Just right**:)                                                                             | **Too positive**→                                                         |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **resources**       | provides no additional resources or pointers                               | **suggests reference resources and pointers**                                                | provides no additional resources or pointers                              |
| **purpose**         | serves the critic’s ego                                                    | **serves the needs of the other person and the needs of the project**                        | neglects the other person’s need for constructive feedback                |
| **tone**            | grumpy                                                                     | **respectful**                                                                               | overeager                                                                 |
| **mode of address** | telling                                                                    | **questioning**                                                                              | fawning                                                                   |
| **expectations**    | too high for the other person’s level of work and the stage of the project | **matched to the other person’s level of work and stage of the project**                     | too low for the other person’s level of work and the stage of the project |
| **content**         | all negative                                                               | **identifies both good and bad**                                                             | all positive                                                              |
| **focus**           | personal(“you’re terrible at design”)                                      | **focused on the objective qualities of the work**                                           | personal(“you’re great at design”)                                        |
| **judgement**       | harsh                                                                      | **fair**                                                                                     | uncritical                                                                |
| **effect**          | dispiriting                                                                | **encouraging**                                                                              | bewildering                                                               |
| **attitude**        | unkind                                                                     | **empathetic**                                                                               | sycophantic                                                               |
| **strategy**        | destructive: finds fault everywhere                                        | **constructive: forms judgements against a brief or criteria requested by the other person** | unhelpful: superficial, concealing shortcomings                           |

### For the presenter

Set up the context around the specific problems you are solving with the design(s).

* **Review business goals.** Make sure the business goals are clear and understood. What problem is the business trying to solve with these designs?
* **Review user goals.** Mention the user goals and persona’s in a clear way so the audience/critiquers can focus on the solutions in the right context.
* **Review constraints.** What timeframe, development or business limitations were taken into consideration when creating the designs?
* **Review schedule.** Make sure the team understands the project scope and timeline.
* **Set fidelity expectations.** Make sure the levels of fidelity are clear; (e.g., are we looking at wireframes or visual designs?)
* **Create a clear focus.** Clearly state what it is you want feedback on. “It’s about the navigation, not the design of the header” for instance.

This does not need to be a super neat and shiny presentation, it's not a pitch it's asking for input. Creating 5 or 6 slides that frame your design solution and include the above mentioned topics, should be ample.

### Rules for critique

Good critique is not just about finding faults. The judgements we form can and should cover both positive and negative aspects of the work. As critics, we should strive for fairness, honesty, and empathy. With this attitude, critique starts to look like more of a creative task rather than a destructive one.\
When critique is done well, it 1) identifies the strengths of the work; 2) helps to improve the weaknesses of the work; 3) helps our professional development; 4) enhances mutual trust and collaboration, and 5) ultimately helps entire professions like design to advance and grow.

* **Be prepared** Reading the supplied information (If applicable) makes feedback more actionable
  * Don’t say; I’m not sure about that fold out menu.&#x20;
  * Ask questions about that one solution: Have you explored other options for that fold out menu?
* **Focus on the problem, not the solution** Take a step back and discuss concerns and questions around the current design. It’s up to the designer to come up with solutions.
  * Don’t say; That white text on the yellow button is really poorly legible
  * Do say; Have you looked at the legibility and contrast ratio’s of the entire design?
* **Be straightforward.** Be open about your findings, that way people can really learn from the experience.
  * Don’t be overly friendly about the design; I guess it looks nice!
  * Do say; The overall look and balance of the design is well executed, what do you think?
* **Link feedback to goals** It’s not about personal preferences. Keep it objective. How does the design meet (or miss) the customer and business goals?
  * Don’t say; I think the button should be orange
  * Do say; In order to increase conversions, do you think the call to action is clear enough?
* **Offer suggestions, not demands.** Trust the designer to explore new solutions and make their own call.
  * Don’t say; I used a two column design in a similar project, you should try it
  * Do say; Have you explored less busy grid layouts for this project?
