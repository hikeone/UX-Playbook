# Step by step

{% hint style="success" %}
**First time trying it?** Feel free to talk to Boyd or Leon. We can help you get started.
{% endhint %}

**1. Define you goal**

What do you want to learn? Depending how much you know and how complex your visual design is there are different ways to go about it.\
\
Show the visual design:

* See what people’s ‘gut reaction is = [5 second test](https://usabilityhub.com/guides/five-second-testing)
* Figure out where people would click first = [First click test ](https://usabilityhub.com/guides/first-click-testing)
* Test two or more design directions = [Preference test](https://usabilityhub.com/guides/preference-testing)
* Test the visual design in context = Usability test (after the tasks are completed)

Capture the response:

* Discover which words and description people use to describe a design. Especially helpful in the early stage a design project when you're still trying to figure out what works and what doesn't = Open word choice
* Validate whether the brand attributes are perceived correctly by participants = [Closed reaction words](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/microsoft-desirability-toolkit/)
* Assess the relative strength of each quality (e.g. friendly, clean, professional). Works best when you know a lot about the brand and when you're doing a quantitative research = [Numerical ratings](https://usabilityhub.com/product/design-surveys)\


#### **2. Talk to the (visual) designer.**

* Discuss the visual design. She/he is probably is able to explain the reasoning behind the design. Are you the designer? Great, you definitely know why it looks the way it does.
* Choose 5-7 words she/he would use to describe the design using the [Microsoft Reaction Words](https://paper.dropbox.com/ep/redirect/external-link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nngroup.com%2Farticles%2Fdesirability-reaction-words%2F\&hmac=CbkbQug8bxY7UTzs0NVF6jJSFF8Lh2Vgo%2BN0rjtwNm4%3D) list (or use our [Dutch version](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Microsoft-Reaction-words-English-Nederlandse--Aaf53~oQR8pFnLo8jIvgWU4yAQ-wrrRHfmBHZs70xu2PAdwD)). This is your hypothesis.&#x20;

**3. Compose a list of reaction words.**\
Select 25 (or 64 words max.). 25 is a lot more common.&#x20;

* Always keep the 60/40 percent balance while selecting words.
* Can I choose words that are not on the list? Yes! Discuss with you designer/stakeholder.

#### **4. Create or update your research proposal**

* Define a research question and hypothese by using the 5 words and explain why you choose them.
* Add them to your [research proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19Zhqs0l_bVOodgorCimHh3ZrL9baiNWmrAWGwFfDj3s/edit?usp=sharing)
* Get it approved by the client.

#### **5. Show the design:**

* As a part of a usability test:&#x20;
  * Ask the questions after the usability related questions are done.\

* Stand alone:&#x20;
  * You can show static screenshots, sketches, prints or moodboards.\

* Testing multiple designs.
  * Show 1st design, pick words, ask questions. Repeat with design 2, 3, ect.

#### **6. Capture the response**&#x20;

A. In-person&#x20;

* Print out a A4 with your list of words ([template](https://www.dropbox.com/s/uz2el69ypexlbbs/desirability-test-template.sketch?dl=0))
* Let user review the list and pick 1 to 5 words. Tell the user to notify you when they’re done.&#x20;
* You can leave the room or wait but don’t pressure the user.&#x20;
* When the user is done go through the list and ask them to explain why they chose these words.
* You're probably recording the session so you don’t need to take notes.

B. Unmoderated

* Use [Usabilityhub](https://usabilityhub.com)&#x20;

#### **7. Share the outcome**

* Focus primarily on the 'why': The words they choose are secondary but in most cases you want to know why they choose the words.
* How to share your insights? Word cloud, graph chart, percentage of people ect.
