# Testing a visual design

This method of testing helps you to evaluate how effective the visual design is perceived by your target-audience. It can help a team evaluate if a visual design expresses specific traits (such as ‘open’, ‘playful’, or ‘high quality’).\
\
This test can be done as a part of a [usability test](../usability-test/) or as a stand alone test.

#### **Use this method when you want to:**

* … get feedback on a visual design direction (e.g. a style tile)
* … get feedback on a applied design (e.g. a homepage, poster, sticker)
* … figure out what design works best (e.g. compare multiple design directions)
* … compare an existing design with a new proposal.
* ... convince a client who is not sure about a design.

#### **Time estimate**

Preparation: \
±4 hours.\
\
Conducting the test: \
&#xNAN;_-_ Showing the design: Depends on the method. \
\- Capturing the response: 10min.\
\
Analyzing the data:\
±4 hours.
