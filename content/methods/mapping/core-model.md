  the user and client to achieve their goals.

# Core model

The core model is a method to map content of core pages. It clarifies what content needs to be shown to help the user and our client to achieve their goals.

We use this method in early stages of the project when content is unclear. It helps us to align all stakeholders, find agreement upon core pages and it’s content. Plus it creates awareness of the differen ‘paths’ users take to navigate through the site. The output of this session is a good understanding of core pages with identified content and functionalities with priority, what provides input for your design concepts.

## How to

A core page is a page where business goals and user tasks comes together. To select the core pages you need to have the main tasks of the user (through top task analysis, existing research or statistics) and the business goals (through client) clear.

With this information you can start mapping out all the pages we have in order to find the ones with a clear overlap between business goals and main user tasks. Typically, a digital product has a lot of pages that doesn’t help users meet their goals. When you have set aside the nonessential pages, you are left with the core.

1. Introduction round of participants, quickly states their role and involvement.
2. Introduce the core model and the defined core pages
3. Divide participants in groups (around 3) and hand out the core model sheets
4. Start with first core page, all groups fill in the model for the same core page.
   * &#x20;Fill in business goals: What do they want to communicate & facilitate? Why do they want to do so, what are the reasons?
   * Fill in the user goals: Why does a user come to the page? What does he hope to achieve? What question needs answering?
   * Define inward paths. How might people find this page? How did they get here? Where did they come from? (e.g.Google, login page, link on homepage, etc).
   * Determine core content. Use the business goals, user goals and inward paths to define the most important content and functionalities that need to be mapped on the page.
   * Define outward paths. In the light of the newly defined page content: What are the logical follow up areas? Where do you want to send your user next? (can be based on business goals)
5. Let each group present their core model sheet to the other groups. Make sure it’s a quick but take time to discuss the overlap and the differences between the filled in models.
6. Pick up next core page(s) with a new core model sheet and repeat 4a-e.
7. Finish up with asking how participants experienced the session and what will be the next step.
8. Gather all core model sheets and input for next steps in creating design concepts.

### **Tips**

* Invite participants who create content, work with the content have strong opinions about the website and who should collaborate but aren't.
* Show a sitemap to provide useful context for the core pages
* If no core pages have been selected: quickly do a votinground to continue with the session
* Point out that you are designing a new page, so participants don’t have to take into account the existing one.
* It’s up to your participants how they want to fill in the content. Some prefer to write down a bullet list, others start sketching page layouts. Any visual form is fine.
* Don’t stress yourself trying to reach agreement on all points, just let everybody clarify their viewpoint during their presentation.
* Timebox! Set a timer of 30 minutes for filling in each core model sheet. This way you can expect to get 4 core pages done.
* When filling in the core page, shortly discuss the outcome of each step (5 min). Doing this will generate new ideas and questions that the groups can incorporate into their worksheet.
* Note the inward and outward paths. They might reveal important core pages or force you the re-assess your core page choices.&#x20;
* A good next step after the core model session is a sketch session, where you sketch out the main pages based on the outcomes of this workshop. Depending on the time you have and the size of the group, you can also combine these two sessions.
