# Object Oriented UX

Object Oriented UX is an approach to structure (digital) products based on objects rather than actions. Designing with Object Oriented UX principles makes an application logic and coherent, in stead of a set of unrelated user stories. The principles of OOUX are especially relevant at an early stage in the design process, when structuring the content of the application. Making an OOUX analysis is helpful when designing a complex application, to understand the different topics and how they are related.&#x20;

## OOUX analysis

1. Collect all terms that are relevant to the application. These can be different users (if there are different account types for example), content-topics, objects. Write each on a post-it.
2. Combine words that represent the same object.&#x20;
3. Draw the relations between the objects. Take out lesser relevant objects if required.&#x20;
4. Verify the meaning and relation of different objects with your client(andexpert users?).

### Tips

* First do expert interviews, user interviews or a review of the existing application to get insights into which objects are most relevant. Pay attention to vocabulary.&#x20;
* You can use the relation of objects as starting point to design the navigation through the application.
* If you have trouble explaining the structure to your stakeholders, try to use physical objects with different and similar characteristics to explain dependencies.&#x20;
* This can be done as an individual exercise, or as a workshop with stakeholders.&#x20;
* Extract the words (objects) and relations from your users, so the structure you create reflects their logic, not yours.&#x20;
* You can follow the exact method as prescribed by [Sophia Pater](https://alistapart.com/article/object-oriented-ux), or just use the principles of OOUX.&#x20;
