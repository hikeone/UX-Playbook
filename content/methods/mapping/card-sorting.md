# Card sorting

{% hint style="info" %}
**Card sorting - Miro board**

For a quick start in a Card sorting project, see the Card sort Miro board. It inlcudes references, planning & team, example projects and guidelines on analysing the card sorting results

{% endhint %}

Card sorting can be used for designing new content structures, re-arranging existing structures or adding content to existing structure. And as a bonus it also helps improving labelling of your content! The test is an easy and cheap way to involve users. \
The workshop consists of users grouping the content that is printed on cards. Simple right? On the day of the test you will present a package of cards with all the content to your user group. It is advisable to have between 50-80 cards.

#### **Open or closed**

In an open card sort test, the user decides how many groups there will be. At the end of the test they give every group a name. It helps to provide a maximum of groups in advance to give the user some direction. A closed cart sorting test means that you define group names and the number of groups in advance. This means that the user only has to sort cards in a group.&#x20;

#### **Single user or group panel**

Having a group of users in the workshop can have multiple advantages:

* the discussion can lead to new ideas
* if it is a system they have to use together later, making a joint decision will help with adoption.

Having a single user per workshop means you have more time to hear individual opinions.

#### **Online or offline**

There are multiple software packages which help you execute the test remotely. This is useful if your user group is in a different region or country. Also the software helps you analyse the results.\
Having a person sitting in front of you is slightly preferable because:&#x20;

* not having to worry about a good connection&#x20;
* optimal communication
* better overview of all the cards
* easy to understand

## How to

1. Decide on open or closed, group or single.
2. Make an inventory of the current content. (e.g.in Google Sheets)
3. Print each content item on individual A6 card (e.g.using inDesign template). Also bring empty cards so you can add missing content later on.
4. Invite participants (users of the product).
5. When starting the workshop, explain the proces to those present.
6. Shuffle the cards and let the participant pick a card and read it out loud. Let them explain what it means. If it is not clear, ask if they can think of a new label. Take an empty card and write down the label. Replace the other card.
7. Aks the participant to put the card in a group or to create a group.&#x20;
8. Repeat untill all the cards are used.
9. Ask if any content or functionality is missing
10. Give the user empty cards and ask them to label the groups.&#x20;
11. Wrap up and thank the participants.
12. After one or more sessions, compare the labels that were given to groups. A spreadsheet can help provide an overview of the amount of categories, differences and corresponding groups.
13. Review all your notes. What where the remarks about the labelling of the content?
14. Which items where grouped together most often? Were there any items that took longer to categorise?
15. Create a document with your proposal for a new content structure and a list of possible discussion topics.

### Tips

* Offer some cookies and tea&#x20;
* Take a picture of the resulting card groups
* Conduct a dry-run with a colleague
* Decide upfront how long you want each session to take
