# UI Animation

UI animation is a powerful thing. When applied properly it can lead to a significantly better and intuitive user experience. At Hike One we want to create the best experiences, thus animation is an integral part of every project.

### **UI Animation vs Motion Design**

Let’s get one thing out of the way first. _Motion Design_ sounds way better than _UI Animation_. The problem is that it doesn’t cover it all. Next to motion, UI animations can include changes in colour, opacity, shadows, blurs and scale. Sound and haptics are also very closely related to this domain of design. That’s why we prefer to use the term UI Animation.

_Motion design_ or _Motion graphics_ fall under _UI Animation_ in the form of moving illustrations for example, but can also be seen as something separate.
