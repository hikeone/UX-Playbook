# Brand Essentials (guidelines)

A Brand Essentials document is the most basic form of brand identity guidelines, and our final deliverable in a brand identity project. It contains just enough information for a designer to start designing, but still leaves some room for interpretation and modification. After all, you really find out if a visual identity works once you actually start applying it.
