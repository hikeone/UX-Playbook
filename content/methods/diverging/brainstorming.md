# Brainstorming

Brainstorming is a way to generate ideas in the design process. There are many different brainstorming techniques, and they can be used to come up with concept solutions in the beginning of a project (what direction should the project go?) or detail solutions throughout the project. You should use it to come up with a range of solutions anytime you need new ideas for your project. The outcome is a stack of ideas, from which you can pick the most relevant ones. For this, see [Deciding](../deciding/).&#x20;

## How to

1. Define the problem or context you want ideas for. The more precise your question, the better you will be able to come up with relevant ideas.&#x20;
2. Make a planning with a sequence of different techniques. (see [the books](brainstorming.md#learn-more) below) Don’t forget to add breaks.&#x20;
3. Prepare all the materials you need for the exercises you chose. Bring drinks and snacks. Choose a space where you won’t be disturbed.
4. Stick to the planning you made. Set a timer for the exercises.&#x20;
5. Admire all your hard work!

### Tips

* To get in the brainstorm-mood, start with an exercise unrelated to your problem. Like: “how to get ants to Mars?”
* Always start with a braindump, to get your first obvious ideas out of your system.&#x20;
* No idea is too crazy in a brainstorm. The goal is to come up with new and refreshing concepts, they don’t have to be realistic yet.&#x20;
* A person cannot diverge and converge at the same time. Brainstorming is a part of diverging, so do not think in constraints.
* If you think you are out of ideas, keep going. This is when the interesting ideas start to surface.
* Time restraints can help you focus your energy and push you to put down your ideas instead of thinking them over. Many techniques in the books below use a form of time restraint.&#x20;
* Choose a time of the day you are most productive. Brainstorming will take a lot of your energy, so don’t try to do something energy consuming before and after as well.
* If you are planning a longer idea generation session, plan breaks and snacks to manage your energy level.&#x20;
* You can brainstorm on your own, or in a group. Choose the techniques you want to use accordingly. Do you want to organise a session together with the client or stakeholders? Read: sketch session.&#x20;
* If you are brainstorming with others, always be supportive of others’ ideas. Remember: there are no bad ideas in a brainstorm.&#x20;
* Do you have multiple problems you want to solve? Divide them, and plan a brainstorming session for each individually. (These can also be short and followed by each other.) Trying to solve multiple problems at once can block you fromcomingup with individual solutions. You can combine possible solutions later on.&#x20;
