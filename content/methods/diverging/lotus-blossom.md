# Lotus Blossom

Invented in Japan, the Lotus Blossom method is a framework for generating ideas, starting from one central theme (problem), expanding outwards with related themes in an iterative manner.

## Description

The Lotus Blossom method adds focus and power to the classic brainstorming by focusing on areas of interest. Once mastered, the technique can help you create more and higher quality ideas quickly, find innovative ways of improving your business, and solve a variety of problems. The output of this exercise is a visual map of different ways to explore a certain theme.

## How to

1. Use a single sheet of paper (or a digital board, like FigJam).
2. Write down the central theme on a sticky note and put it in the middle of the prepared sheet (digital board).
3. Think of 8 related ideas and write them around the central theme, using a new sticky note for each idea.

4. Take each of the previous 8 ideas, and create 8 new ideas around each of them. Again, use a new sticky note for each idea.

5. Blossom as far as you think it's relevant!

## Tips

* Don't judge, there is nothing like a bad idea
* If there are similar ideas on two separate sticky notes, try to combine them into one
* The exercise should be done in a group of max. 5 people
* The exercise shouldn't take more than 30 min
