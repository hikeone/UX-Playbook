# Sketching

Sketching is used to expand upon solution ideas. In this exercise, every team member spend time on articulating one idea they are most interested in. The sketch can be a new idea, or combination of earlier ideas - it can even include (parts of) other people's ideas.

The goal is to create one fully fleshed out idea for the solution that is thought to be the best. Each team member creates their own detailed Solution Sketch. A Solution Sketch should include three frames or states of the concept to help illustrate how it works, as well as a clear title to help people remember it.

The [dot voting ](../deciding/dot-voting.md)technique can be used to select the best ideas from multiple solution sketches.
