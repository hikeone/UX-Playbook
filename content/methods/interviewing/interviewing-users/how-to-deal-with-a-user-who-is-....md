<summary>🫨 Overly Talkative Participant (Goes Off-Topic)</summary>

* Gently **steer them back**: _“That’s really interesting! I’d love to circle back to \[the topic]. Can you tell me more about…”_

- Use **time cues**: _“I want to make sure we cover everything in the time we have. Let’s focus on…”_

* If needed, **politely interrupt**: _“Sorry to cut in, but I want to be mindful of time. Let’s go back to…”_

<summary>😤 Angry or Frustrated Participant</summary>

* Stay calm and neutral. **Don’t take it personally**.

- **Acknowledge their frustration**: “I can see this is a frustrating experience for you. I really appreciate you sharing your thoughts.”

* If they’re upset about the product/service, **validate their feelings but redirect**: _“That’s really helpful feedback. Can you tell me more about what you expected instead?”_

- If they’re getting aggressive, **set boundaries**: “I understand this is important to you, but I want to make sure we can have a productive conversation. Let’s focus on \[specific topic].”

<summary>🫢 Silent or One-Word Answer </summary>

* Use **open-ended questions**: _“Can you describe that in more detail?”_ or _“What was going through your mind when you did that?”_
* Use **pauses**—sometimes people will fill the silence if you wait a few seconds.
* **Offer options**: _“Would you say your experience was frustrating, confusing, or something else?”_
* Try **reframing**: If they don’t respond well to abstract questions, ask about a specific past experience.
