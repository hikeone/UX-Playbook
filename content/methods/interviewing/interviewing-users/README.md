# Interviewing users

Interviews can be structured (with a fixed set of questions), semi-structured (a mix of prepared questions and open-ended discussion), or unstructured (more exploratory and free-flowing). \
\
Interviews help uncover deep insights that usability testing or analytics might miss, such as motivations, emotions, and decision-making processes. \
\
They are especially useful in the early stages of design to inform product direction or after launch to refine and improve user experiences. However, because interviews rely on self-reported data, they should be complemented with observational methods for a more complete picture.
