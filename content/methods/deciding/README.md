# ðŸ”¨  Decide

Decisions can be made based on intuition (gut feeling) or based on reasoning.(Although some scientists believe intuition is just very fast unconscious reasoning.) To increase the effectivity of decision making (within groups) you can follow one of the methods below. Some methods are more applicable for â€˜largeâ€™ decisions, like determining the scope of the project with the client. Others are applicable for â€˜smallâ€™ decisions, like selecting ideas from a brainstorm. In any case the goal is to move the project forward in an effective manner.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Ideally you want to be diverging and converging throughout the design process. So you can repeat methods from divergingâ€™ and â€˜decidingâ€™ at different points in the project.&#x20;
