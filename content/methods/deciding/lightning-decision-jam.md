# Lightning decision jam

Solve tough issues within an hour. A lightning decision jam is an easy to use workshop method to quickly bring out problems and ideas from a group and move them into actionable next steps.&#x20;

## How to

1. **Draw a sailboat on the wall.** Ensure it has a sail and an archor. The sail represents everything that is pushing us forward (above water), the anchor represents your challenges / what is holding us back.
2. **(4min) Write down what is pushing us forward**. Seperate post-it for every item!\
   Afterwards, go one-by one to stick your post-its on the wall (around the sail / above the water) and read them out-loud so everyone can hear.&#x20;
3. **(4min) Write down all challenges**. Seperate post-it for every item!\
   Afterwards, put them on the wall (around the anchor / below the water). Do this all at once without reading them out-loud: you don't want to focus on the negative.&#x20;
4. **(3min) Prioritise the problems.** Each person in the team gets three dot votes. Vote for the problems you feel are the biggest (in silence). If you see duplicates: just put the post-its on top of each-other. \
   Afterwards, take the top-votes problems apart and arrange them to popularity.&#x20;
5. **(3min) Reframe problems as challenges.** Facilitator creates a How Might We from the top-voted problem(s). \
   e.g. "_Office is too loud_" becomes "_How might we accomodate people who need quiet in the office?_"
6. **(5min) Ideating without discussion.** Everyone gets a block of post-its. Come up with as many solutions as you can. Ensure what you write on a post-it is self-explanatory - you wonâ€™t be presenting your solutions. After the 4 minutes, stick them all on the wall (in silence, all at once).
7. **(4min) Voting and prioritising** Every team member gets 6 dots to vote for the best solutions. No discussion. Duplicates? Just put them together. Prioritise the solutions based on the amount of votes.
8.  (**10min) Choose what to execute** Draw an effort/impact scale. \
    Y-scale: how much impact will this solution have? How successful do we think this solution will be?

    X scale: how much effort will it take? How expensive will it be?

    Facilitator is guide in the process: start with the most-voted for solution in the center of the graph and ask the group higher/lower. Your first post-it is the anchor / baseline. All others can be placed relative to that one. Plot all solutions (or as many as you manage in 10 minutes)
9.  **(5min) Make the solution actionable** (5min)

    Start with one solution: take the top-left solution to start an experiment with.

    Make it actionable: write down at least 3 actionable steps needed to start an experiment.&#x20;



### Tips

* Start with the positives: it's easier to come up with corresponding negatives. Also, when you start with the challenges it creates a bit of a negative atmosphere.
* Start small: an experiment should be something you can execute quickly and easily.&#x20;
* This is an exercise that can easily be done remotely using a tool like Figma or Miro
