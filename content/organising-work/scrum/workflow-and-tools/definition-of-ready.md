# Definition of ready

The aim of the definition of ready is to ensure backlog tickets (user stories and bugs) can be completed within a sprint. **Tickets can only be added to a sprint when they meet the definition of ready.**

### Boilerplate

Below is a suggestion for a definition of ready:

> Each backlog ticket:
>
> * has a **short descriptive title**
> * has a **user story** which captures the added value for a user (see [writing user stories](user-stories.md))
> * has a list of **acceptance criteria** (see [writing user stories](user-stories.md))
> * includes a **concept design** so everyone understands the direction of the solution
>
> Bugs have a **bug report** which explain what happens, what should happen, when it happens and how bad it is (see [writing bug reports](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Writing-Bug-Reports--AIopCD4~3Mh2ud_pMYJxzXeIAg-YZKvYkPHMG3jPXKAV3xKa)).

### Adapt for your project

You should adapt this definition to meet the needs of your project. Typically your definition should include things that would otherwise cause impediments during a sprint. If for example your project is built around 3D models made by a third party, you can add “required 3D models are available in format X on platform Y”.&#x20;
