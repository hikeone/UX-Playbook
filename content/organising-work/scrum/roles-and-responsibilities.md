* Informing the Scrum Master/Product Owner of impediments.

## Your role vs. my role

* Define your own and the other roles by answering the following questions:
  * What are 2-3 important deliverables, tasks or other ways you help the team?
  * What kind of support do you need and from which role?
* Share and compare notes in order to come to an agreement.
* Use dot votes in order to define the most important deliverables and tasks.
* Draw different circles on the board each representing a role.
* Use the dot voted sticky notes to annotate each role with their most important deliverables, tasks and responsibilities.
* Draw interaction lines between the different roles; use thick lines to indicate most important interactions.
* As a facilitator, make sure that you capture and summarise and ask questions when something is vague.
* At the end of the session everybody should have come to an agreement.
* Write all the conclusions in an email and send it around to make sure that everybody has the same information and that you have something you can fall back on
