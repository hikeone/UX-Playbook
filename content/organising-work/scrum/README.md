# Scrum

It is said that Scrum is based on three major pillars which are: transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

**Transparency:**\
The team is responsible for the outcome of the project and therefore all the aspects and the process must be visible to the ones who are responsible.\
\
**Inspection:**\
With the use of the artifacts (product backlog, sprint backlog and increment) the team inspects its progress towards the sprint goal.\
\
**Adaptation:**\
In order to make sure the team remains on the 'right' track, it must inspect progress continuously and be able to adapt it's track when necessary. Scrum uses it's four formal events to inspect and adapt, these events are described under [Scrum events](key-activities/).

## Sprint

Scrum works in iterations called Sprints. A sprint is a time-boxed event of one month or less during which a ‘[done](workflow-and-tools/definition-of-done.md)’, usable, and potentially releasable product increment is created. It also contains time-boxed scrum events such as: daily stand-ups, sprint planning, sprint review and the retrospective. \
\
A few 'rules' to follow:

* Sprints maintain their length throughout the development period.
* A new sprint starts immediately after the last sprint (usually after [planning](key-activities/sprint-planning.md)).
* Each sprint has a sprint goal of what is to be built, a design and flexible plan that will guide building it, the work, and the resultant product increment.
* No new work can be pushed in the sprint, because the team has already committed to a certain set of tickets. However, the team is allowed to pull additional work in the current sprint if it determines there is additional capacity, from the top of the backlog.
* When the team has overcommitted, the team should collaborate and renegotiate with the Product Owner.
* All stakeholders are invited to attend the sprint review.
