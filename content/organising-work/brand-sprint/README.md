# Brand Identity Sprint

In a Brand Identity Sprint, we want to gain a deep understanding of the (new) brand, as well as distil a clear brief for the designer that will be creating the visual identity. For this reason, we are combining Jake Knapp’s **Brand Sprint** with a **Visual Identity Sprint**.

The **Brand Sprint** will set a solid brand foundation in which a company roadmap, purpose, core values, audience, personality and positioning all come into play. It takes about three hours

The **Visual Identity Sprint** is done whenever a significant visual exploration needs to occur for a brand. Purpose: to immediately follow a brand sprint in order to distil a design brief. It takes about two hours.

The outcome of both sessions will set the starting point from which a visual identity, product design, company culture and communication strategy can be built on. The sessions can also be used individually, but in most cases, it’s the combination that will set the most solid foundation.
