# Roles and responsibilities

To make your lean innovation projects into a success you need at least three disciples presented in your core team:

### Decider

The decider brings domain knowledge, makes the decisions and steers the project in the right direction. He or she also manages stakeholders and updates the organization of the progress that is made.

### Marketeer

Responsible for the commercial viability of your product. The marketeer builds a path to your customers, early on. He or she has a strong focus on the value proposition of your product, how to position it on the market and sets up the metrics to track success.

### Designer

Designs the product, prepares the tests and makes the prototypes. Prioritises experimentation over perfection and has a strong focus on how to validate assumptions.
