# Kanban vs. Scrum

|                     | Scrum                                                                                                                               | Kanban                                                           |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cadence             | Regular fixed length sprints (ie, 2 weeks)                                                                                          |  Continuous flow                                                 |
| Release methodology | At the end of each sprint if approved by the product owner                                                                          | Continuous delivery or at the team's discretion                  |
| Roles               | Product owner, scrum master, development team                                                                                       | No existing roles. Some teams enlist the help of an agile coach. |
| Key metrics         | Velocity                                                                                                                            | Cycle time                                                       |
| Change philosophy   | Teams should strive to not make changes to the sprint forecast during the sprint. Doing so compromises learnings around estimation. | Change can happen at any time                                    |
