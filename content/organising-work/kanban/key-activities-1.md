# Key activities

Even though kanban doesn't prescribe any re-occuring events as strickt as Scrum does it is considered very helpful to implement events hwne necessary.

**Daily**\
In order to make sure that the team is aligned with all the tasks ahead it might be useful to consider having a daily discussion near the Kanban board. Keep the pull principle in mind, which entails that the board is discussed from right to left.&#x20;

**Retrospective**\
When bottlenecks become visible (stacking of tickets) have a retrospective togehter to determine the way forward in oder to remove these bottlenecks (maybe you will need to increase the WIP or have a look at the resources and their skills).
