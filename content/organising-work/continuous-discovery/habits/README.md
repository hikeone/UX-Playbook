  In order for people to get the hang of Continuous Discovery, the framework can
  be broken down into habits.

# Habits

The habits and the way of working with them are described in the book [Continuous Discovery Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Discovery-Habits-Discover-Products/dp/1736633309/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=continuous+discovery+habits) by Teresa Torres. Her advice is to [assess organisational context, pick a habit to start with, and iterate from there](https://www.producttalk.org/2023/08/getting-started-with-discovery/).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Advise your team to read the book and implement what they read as they go: whenever you read something you can start doing, don't wait, just give it a go the next working day.
{% endhint %}

At Hike One, we tried to standardise teaching teams the Continuous Discovery habits by creating a workflow and some workshops and sessions around them.

{% hint style="info" %}
There are 11 habits, but so far, we have actively applied only 9 habits at clients. This is why they are numbered #1-9.

Instead of experience mapping together with clients, we have used customer journey maps provided by them to map out product outcomes and opportunities.

With regards to managing the cycles, this is something we as Hike One are continuously doing as we coach teams, but it hasn't been something to really focus on together with them.
