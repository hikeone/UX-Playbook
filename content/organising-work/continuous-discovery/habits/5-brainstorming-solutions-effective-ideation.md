# #5 Brainstorming solutions (effective ideation)

A solution is anything that **addresses a known opportunity**.&#x20;

Always consider **multiple** solutions (generate multiple ideas) for a single opportunity, and **compare-and-contrast** them to decide which to move forward with.&#x20;

Always try to **break up solutions into small parts** that individually address an individual opportunity. If we try to deliver one huge solution that addresses many opportunities, it will take us too long to deliver value. Ship often and learn fast.&#x20;

## A word on risk

Whenever we put a solution in our delivery backlog, we are making a **bet**. We need to define how much risk comes with building the solution, and whether or not we can take the risk of placing the bet. Discovery helps us reduce the risk of that bet. How much of it we need to mitigate depends on how much risk the organisation can bear and how much time we have to make a decision. For more info on mitigating risk, see [6-identifying-underlying-assumptions.md](6-identifying-underlying-assumptions.md "mention").
