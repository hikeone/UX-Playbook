# #4 Prioritising opportunities

Opportunities are assessed and prioritised to decide what to focus on. What customer insights will most likely **drive the product outcome**?

We assess (sub-)opportunities by defining how many customers are impacted by it, how often, and how important it is to our customers, and by evaluating how addressing an opportunity might affect our position in the market, and by how well an opportunity fits with our company vision, mission, and strategic objectives, Ultimately, we want to estimate how much impact addressing each opportunity would have on our desired outcome.
