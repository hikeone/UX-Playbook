# #8 Measuring impact

We need to track behaviour to gather evidence and make decisions to keep moving toward our desired outcomes.&#x20;

Measuring impact per shipped item can be done like we do in every other experiment: What is the **change** we implemented? What is the **value** that we believed to gain from it? How have we **measured** if we did indeed gain this value? What was the **result** (quantified)?&#x20;

And eventually, we measure impact by the total effect the changes we made in a specific amount of time have had on our desired product and business outcomes (and we can chart every time period we measure to track progress).

{% hint style="info" %}
Donâ€™t measure everything. Only measure:

* what you need to give you insights on user behaviour
* what you need to give yourself the clearance to move on to a next product outcome or opportunity (when is it enough)
{% endhint %}

## Tools

* Product analytics tool such as [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/) or [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/), or for mobile apps [Smartlook](https://www.smartlook.com/)&#x20;
