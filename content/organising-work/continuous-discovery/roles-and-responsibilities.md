  data analyst.

# Roles and responsibilities

## Product trio (client)

The [product trio](https://www.producttalk.org/2021/05/product-trio/) is typically comprised of a product manager, a designer, and a software engineer. Together, they are responsible for a shared outcome. So together, they _lead_ product discovery. Other team members can be consulted based on which decisions the team needs to make.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The product trio can consist of more people. However, the more people are involved in every decision, the longer each decision will take, and the longer it will take to ship value to customers. Try to limit who _leads_ discovery.
{% endhint %}

## Decider (client)

The decider is the one who makes decisions. They have mandate from the company to decide on a direction for the product. This kind of goes against the whole product trio thing, but we are an agency and we're dealing with clients who do a project with us. There is usually an initiator who wants to try something, and who needs to prove to their stakeholders or management that their idea will work. Our client is not ready to give autonomy to the product team, but the fact that the initiator and the company have decided to apply Continuous Discovery is proof that they are willing to relinquish control.

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;Help our client get to that point where they give the decider role back. Try to use the decider to define outcomes – but always together with the product trio – and make them let go bit by bit.
