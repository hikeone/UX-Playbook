# Kick-off / inventory

This workshop takes up to 4 hours, depending on what you need to discuss.

## **Attendees**

* Hiker(s) on the project
* Decider
* Product trio (this can be more than 3 people but try to keep it small in order to be able to make quick decisions)
* Preferably also the rest of the product team, since the P3 are not the only ones who should apply Continuous Discovery, they're just the decision makers

## Content

See Hike One kick-off template in Miro. Add some information about Continuous Discovery habits based on what you already discussed in the introductory talk and maybe what else you already know about the team and their struggles. See everything under [explore](../explore/ "mention") and [materialise](../materialise/ "mention") to create a planning with the team.
