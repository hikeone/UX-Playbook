# Introduction to Continuous Discovery

Before we start doing anything, the team should get acquainted with the why, how and what of Continuous Discovery. Invite the whole product team for an introduction on the topic.&#x20;

This talk takes up to 1 hour.

* Introduce yourself and Hike One
* Ask team members to introduce themselves – and tell you when was the last time they talked to a user
* Introduce Continuous Discovery (you will have sent everybody the book before starting the project, so hopefully they'll have gotten started and have an idea of what it is by now)
* Explain why this team will start implementing Continuous Discovery – what was the reason we got this assignment?
* Tell them about next steps – when is the next session we'll do together, what do they need to prepare, and is there any (part of a) habit they can already start applying by themselves today?
* Q\&A and closing
