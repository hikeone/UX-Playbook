# Learnings & impact

We want to take decisions about next steps based on evidence we collected. To do that, we share the evidence that was collected through experiments last week, and discuss what this means.

Also see [7-rapid-testing-experimenting.md](../../habits/7-rapid-testing-experimenting.md "mention").

{% hint style="info" %}
Facilitate this meeting as a Holacracy tactical. Build a tension-based agenda, make sure everyone gets what they need (usually they need to go into a Sprint planning after this, so they have to know what CD related tasks have to go into their Sprint Backlog), and keep it within the timebox. Take max 60 minutes.
