# Groom opportunity solution tree

We want an up-to-date visualisation of paths we might take to reach our desired outcome.&#x20;

Also see[3-visualising-the-opportunity-solution-tree-opportunity-mapping.md](../../habits/3-visualising-the-opportunity-solution-tree-opportunity-mapping.md "mention").

Just like the digital product itself, the opportunity solution tree is never finished. That's why we groom the opportunity solution tree. However, there's no fixed way of working here. Depending on what has happened in the past week, you may want to work on:

* (Re-)[1-defining-outcomes.md](../../habits/1-defining-outcomes.md "mention"), because things change.
* [7-rapid-testing-experimenting.md](../../habits/7-rapid-testing-experimenting.md "mention"), which could be either creating new experiments or refining existing ones.&#x20;
* [6-identifying-underlying-assumptions.md](../../habits/6-identifying-underlying-assumptions.md "mention"), and prioritising them to decide which ones to experiment with.
* [5-brainstorming-solutions-effective-ideation.md](../../habits/5-brainstorming-solutions-effective-ideation.md "mention") that might address new(ly prioritised) opportunities.
* [4-prioritising-opportunities.md](../../habits/4-prioritising-opportunities.md "mention") that emerged from yesterday's interview.
* Restructuring / grooming the tree (see [3-visualising-the-opportunity-solution-tree-opportunity-mapping.md](../../habits/3-visualising-the-opportunity-solution-tree-opportunity-mapping.md "mention"))&#x20;

For each grooming session, take at least an hour . Take 2 if you can.
