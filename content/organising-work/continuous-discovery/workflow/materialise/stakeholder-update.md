# Stakeholder update

We want to align, collaborate and learn, and ultimately achieve shared goals (thereby gaining trust and becoming more autonomous as a product team).

Every week, Sprint, month (whatever works for your team and their stakeholders), show your work to stakeholders. Always follow the why, how, what format. Go into story mode to zoom in on the part of the opportunity solution tree you're working on, and how it connects to goals that matter to stakeholders.&#x20;

The focus is always on collaboration, learning, and impact:

* Share learnings and decisions taken based on those learnings
* Share impact in terms of user behaviour and discuss impact on business goals
* Request and integrate feedback
* Invite stakeholders to join whatever you're working on, either as a fly on the wall or to co-create
