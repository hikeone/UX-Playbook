# User interview

We want to understand our customer and build the product they will love to use. That's why the product team interviews at least one customer per week for at least 20 minutes to discover opportunities. We ask for specific stories, and we share our current work to get early feedback and maybe even co-create with our customer. Immediately after doing the interview, create an interview snapshot or use any other way to capture important learnings.
