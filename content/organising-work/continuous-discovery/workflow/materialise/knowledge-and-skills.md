# Knowledge & skills

We want our product teams to have a toolbox of knowledge, skills and practice to help them confidently apply Continuous Discovery. And we want to encourage a learning culture within the entire organisation.

Pick a day that makes sense for your team (and other interested people) and do a weekly session to focus on one habit:

* &#x20;Max 30 minutes to highlight the habit&#x20;
* At least 30 minutes workshop to have each participant apply this habit to their current work and discuss / advise each other as a group&#x20;
* 15 minute break
* Max 45 minutes to dive into a specific practical skill that matches the highlighted habit, such as how to set up or execute user interviews or how to do quantitative or qualitative data analysis

If you don't have the luxury of taking 2 hours each time, do the first hour one week and the second hour the next.
