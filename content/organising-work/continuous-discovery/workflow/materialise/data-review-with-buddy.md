# Data review with buddy

We want a clear list of needs for the [learnings-and-impact.md](learnings-and-impact.md "mention") sessions. That's where we share evidence that was collected last week, and discuss what this evidence means in order to decide about next steps.&#x20;

To decide what to present there (share information, ask for information, request a next action or a project), each duo goes over their experiments and any other data that was collected this week, analyses it and discusses what results mean.

{% hint style="info" %}
It's up to the team how much time they want to dedicate to reviewing data. Of course, it depends on the amount and type of experiments that were executed. There's also the user interview learnings to check out.
