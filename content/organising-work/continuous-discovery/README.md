# Continuous Discovery

A digital product is never finished. Good product teams know that we can always create more value for our customers and in turn create more value for the business. This is referred to as 'product thinking' or as having a 'product mindset'.&#x20;

Product discovery is the work we do to make decisions about what to build, whereas product delivery is the work we do to build, ship and maintain a quality product.&#x20;

Good product discovery includes the customer throughout the decision-making process. We make product decisions every day. We don't want them to be guesses.&#x20;

At Hike One, our approach to product discovery is [Continuous Discovery](https://www.producttalk.org/2021/08/product-discovery/). It's a way for us to help clients bridge the gap between business and product, and build the right thing.&#x20;

The heart of Continuous Discovery is an opportunity solution tree. The top of the tree is our desired outcome. This is the impact we're trying to make as a product team. We build and restructure the rest of the tree by continuously executing small research activities: **interviewing** to discover opportunities, and **assumption testing** to evaluate solutions.
