# Cross-Cultural

It can be easy to think that every user you are designing for is just like you. But chances are, they are actually quite different. As user experience designers we are aware of this, which is why we conduct user research. Especially when designing for cultures other than your own, it is important to research your target group. Below is an overview of topics to pay extra attention to when designing for other countries and cultures—which should actually always be taken into consideration.

## Things to consider

* [Alphabet & reading orientation](cross-cultural-design.md#alphabet-and-reading-orientation)
* [Text-length in different languages](cross-cultural-design.md#text-length-in-different-languages)
* [Legal matters](cross-cultural-design.md#legal-matters)
* [Common devices](cross-cultural-design.md#common-devices)
* [Context ](cross-cultural-design.md#context)
* [Cultural characteristics](cross-cultural-design.md#cultural-characteristics)
* [Local copy & expressions](cross-cultural-design.md#local-copy-and-expressions)
* [Local UI patterns](cross-cultural-design.md#local-ui-patterns)
* [Colour](cross-cultural-design.md#colour)
* [Imagery ](cross-cultural-design.md#imagery)
* [Tips](cross-cultural-design.md#tips)

### Alphabet & reading orientation

Latin script languages like English and Dutch go from left to right, from top to bottom. However, other languages like Hebrew and Arabic are written [right to left](https://rtlstyling.com/posts/rtl-styling), and East Asian languages like Japanese can also be written top to bottom, first. This does not only influence the alignment of text in your application (left-aligned versus right-aligned), but also the order of elements. What is considered ‘first’ or ‘front’ is not the same for everyone.

### Text-length in different languages

The size of a piece of text can highly differ in various languages. Therefore always check your layout in the ‘longest’ language. Consider languages with long sentences (e.g. Spanish) and those with long words (e.g. Finnish).

### Legal matters

Legal matters can influence what has to be shown in your application and in which way. Are you allowed to ask for certain types of information? Do users opt-in or opt-out? Should an entire text be visible or does a link suffice? This is especially relevant during the onboarding of an application, or with regards to purchases.

### Common devices

It is helpful to pay extra attention to the most commonly used devices if you are designing for a specific country. Conditions do not only influence screen size, but also internet availability, stability and speed, for example.&#x20;

### Context

The physical conditions in which the application will be used can differ from those that you yourself are used to.&#x20;

* Are there ‘extreme’ environmental conditions in which the application will be used? Think of outdoors with bright sun, extreme cold, wet environment, etc.
* Do people use their device in transit? Only in private? Is their device part of their identity or is it shared? Is it used purely functionally or recreationally?

### Cultural characteristics

This is the hardest aspect of designing for other cultures, as cultural characteristics often differ in a subtle way and can be hard to read if the culture is unfamiliar to you. Especially when you do speak the language, it can seem that you also understand the culture. One way to get a grip on cultural differences is by using general cultural classifications. Adapt your tone of voice and possibly the order of the flow to the specific culture.&#x20;

### Local copy & expressions

A part of understanding local culture, and communicating in line with that local culture, is understanding local expressions. In order achieve this, it is good practice to hire a local copywriter.&#x20;

### Local UI patterns

Even on the world wide web, the preference for UI patterns can differ from country to country.&#x20;

### Colour

Colours have different connotations in different cultures. White is a colour of mourning in India. [Yellow](https://blog.go-today.com/travel-tips/yellow-mondays-in-thailand/) is the colour of royalty in Thailand. Red symbolizes good fortune and joyin China. Choose wisely and do your research.

### Imagery

Just as in every project, it is important that the imagery you use corresponds with your users. When designing for other countries it can be even more tricky, as you want to avoid showing images of what you think your target group is, instead of what they really are. Think about both people as well as environment.
