# Sketch

Sketch is after Figma our go-to design tool. We use it for all screen-design work, although there are decent alternatives and you are encouraged to explore new tools. Sketch is vector-based, has a desktop app (Mac only), and integrates well with other prototyping and documentation tools. Many designers know how to work with it, and it makes it easy to collaborate on projects. (Although you cannot actually work in the same file at the same time.)

### Tips

* Organise your Sketch file. Make smart use of artboards, pages and symbols. At Hike One we have guidelines on how to structure your file.&#x20;
* The functionalities of Sketch change and are expanded with every update. Keep yourself up to date by following blogposts and/or sharing the latest tips and tricks with your colleagues. Check out our #sketch channel on slack.&#x20;
* Think about naming (of layers, symbols, artboards) already when your file is still empty and uncluttered. Most tools that work together with Sketch, like Principle, InVision or Zeplin, copy the naming from your Sketch file. Also think in advance about what tools you might want to combine Sketch with.&#x20;
