# Hike One File Structure

Check out our [Generic Sketch file](https://www.dropbox.com/work/hike-one_design/01_templates/sketch/Hike-One_generic_Sketchfile)

## Guidelines

### Pages

Use pages to structure your file. A typical project will contain the following pages:

* **Style guide**\
  An interaction designer will have a wireframe version of this page, with just some text styles. A visual designer will have a page with colours, typography and icons. \

* **Pattern library**\
  Containing components and patterns, etc. And their states and explanations.\

* **Iterations**\
  A page(ormultiple pages) containing all the iterations you make. Usually per page, or per concept.\

* **Latest version**\
  Make sure to clearly mark the latest versionin your file, so everyone knows this is the latest and greatest. This can be 1 page with an overview of all latest designs if it is a small project, or separate pages per page/template/design issue if it’s a larger project.\

* **Flows/sitemap (optional)**\
  Containing flows between screens/elements? This can be a flow chart or a range of screens in order, maybe connected with arrows. Check with your ID-colleagues for best practices.&#x20;

### Canvas and Artboards

Make sure you use the same direction in which you place your iterations/versions of artboards  throughout your document so others can consistently read from left to right (or top to bottom) to see a progress in your changes. Typically this will be left to right as Sketch does this automatically when duplicating an artboard, but if top-to-bottom works better for you, do it, that works too. Just be consistent.

{% hint style="info" %}
Do yourself and colleagues a favour: Cluster your artboards + add a large label so you can easily find content in large files. subjects on a large canvas what you are working on where.

### Name your layers & groups

This should not have to be mentioned, but unfortunately this isn’t done by default by everyone: Please make sure to name your layers, or at least name your groups! If you don’t do it on all your artboards, at least do it on your final/latest artboards!\


{% hint style="info" %}
**Pro-tip:** Use smart [plugins](plugins.md) such as [Cleanup Useless Groups](https://github.com/bomberstudios/Cleanup-Useless-Groups) & [Rename it](https://rodi01.github.io/RenameIt/)
{% endhint %}

### Responsive Design

If you’re working on a responsive project (asmost projects are) we have a few best practices:

* Check the [Responsive design](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/dZCYrrKFUBghSYPpZvKji) article
* Keep the designs for different views / breakpoints close together in the file for better readability.&#x20;
