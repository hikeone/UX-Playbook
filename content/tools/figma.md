# Figma

Figma is a vector based design and prototyping tool that has both a browser based version and a desktop version. You can think of it as an alternative to Sketch. The biggest difference is that it autosaves to the cloud, and it allows you to work in the same file with multiple team members simultaneously.  (A kind of DropboxPaper meets Sketch.) Figma has library-support built in native with its own control mechanism. Moreover, Figma enables you to create ‘responsive’ designs with smart pinning and re-sizing options.

Figma is also excellent for working together in the same file at the same time. You can easily share the files with developers (cross platform) and even stakeholders (view mode). Figma has it’s own document/project setup and does not require any saving of files on your system. It auto saves to the cloud and files are accessible via browser or desktop app. Anyone you invite can either modify or view the files - you decide.

### Tips

* Organise your Figma file. Make smart use of frames, pages and components. At Hike One we have guidelines on how to structure your file for Sketch. These apply for Figma too.&#x20;
* Put a weblink to your work on Figma in the Dropbox folder so others can easily find it.
* Use Figma in the prototype day of a designsprint and it will speed up your process.
* To jumpstart your file you can copy a [template file from the Hike One project](https://www.figma.com/files/project/4776329/Hike-One)
